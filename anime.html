                 As players of Monster Hunter and Dungeons and Dragons know, the slime is not exactly the king of the fantasy monsters. So when a 37-year-old Tokyo salaryman dies and wakes up in a world of dragons and magic, he's a little disappointed to find he's become a blind, boneless slime monster.<br> 
                Mikami's middle age hasn't gone as he planned: He never found a girlfriend, he got stuck in a dead-end job, and he was abruptly stabbed to death in the street at 37. So when he wakes up in a new world straight out of a fantasy RPG, he's disappointed but not exactly surprised to find that he's not a knight or a wizard but a blind slime demon. But there are chances for even a slime to become a hero..</p>

                            Assisted by 100 Pegasus Knights from Dwargon, Rimuru's forces destroy the Megalodons and attempt to destroy Charybdis with a full scale attack, but fail. Rimuru then battles Charybdis himself, only to discover it is possessing Phobio, and its true target is Milim. By Rimuru's request, Milim defeats Charybdis while sparing Phobio's life. After the battle, Phobio apologizes for all the trouble he caused, and his master, the Demon Lord Carrion, establishes a non-aggression pact with Tempest. Rimuru and the others finally discover that all the troubles they had faced recently were caused by Clayman's harlequin.</td>

                            Tempest celebrates its victory against Charybdis and treaty with Yuurazania where Rimuru and Milim have a conversation about the perks of becoming a Demon Lord. Suddenly Milim remembers she has something to do and leaves abruptly, promising to let the other Demon Lords know not to interfere with Tempest. That night, Rimuru dreams about Shizu's regret and his promise to help five children, thus deciding to head to the Ingracia Kingdom with Ranga. There he meets with the Grandmaster of Freedom Association Yuuki Kagurazaka and talks about their manga, anime, games and ultimately Shizu and Rimuru's objective.</td>

                            Shizu's students don't show Rimuru much respect so he decides to show them the difference in their skill in a series of duels. Kenya uses fire magic, Chloe water magic, Gale fires magic bullets, Ryota uses body enhancements, and Alice uses puppetry to control toys to attack him. They lose and accept him as sensei. Rimuru visits Treyni, believing the children will survive if inhabited by superior spirits since Shizu was Summoned as a child but lived to adulthood, possibly because of Ifrit. Treyni directs him to the Dwelling of Spirits, but with the Queen of Spirits the dryads once served dead, they have lost their link to it and no longer know the entrance. While on a picnic with the students, they see a Sky Dragon heading to the capital and Rimuru interferes and eats it with Gluttony. Mjolmire, a merchant Rimuru's appearance saved, invites them to dinner. Mjolmire knows who Rimuru is and Rimuru invites him to come to Tempest to help them sell their wares. He agrees. Mjolmire's assistant asks the Queen of Spirits to protect the children after dinner. She tells a curious Rimuru she came from a village near the Dwelling of Spirits. He, Ranga, and children head to its location</td>

                            Shizue Izawa and many other adventurers come in Filtwood to exterminate a very powerful Daemon, rumored to be an Arch Daemon. Those not willing to fight the overwhelming foe are killed by the kingdom, due to which the 'summoned Daemon' causes a ruckus and fights against Shizue. Realizing the mask she wore is an artifact that transcends space and time, the Daemon 'retreats'.
                            At night, Shizue is brought to the throne room, where it is revealed that the Kingdom is under the rule of the Daemon they were ordered to exterminate and that the whole commotion in the day was an act to lure and kill off powerful obstacles of the Daemon, such as Shizue. The summoned Daemon, 'Noir', reappears and kills the Daemon as per his original contract, and makes a deal with Shizue stating that he had killed the Daemon after which she had killed off 'Noir'.
                            Later on, it is found that 'Noir' had been tracking the mask from the Spirit World, eventually finding Rimuru; where it is revealed that this Daemon, 'Noir', shall be later summoned by him and be given the name 'Diablo'.
